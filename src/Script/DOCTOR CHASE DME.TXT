Hi my name is [YOUR NAME] from Prescription Experts I am calling on behalf of a mutual of ours <PATIENT NAME> with a date of birth <DOB>. </br>
We are trying to fax over a Request for a brace from the patient. We just want to make sure we have the correct office.  </br>
</br>
</br>
Is this the office of <DR NAME>? </br>
[IF YES CHECK CONFIRM DOCTOR BOX] </br>
	Ok and is this address correct: <DR ADDRESS> </br>
	And what is correct fax number: <DR FAX NUMBER> </br>
	Ok and who can I make this attention to so we can verify its been received?
	</br>
	Thank you for your help, I will go ahead and fax the brace request and then I will follow up once the request has been sent.</br>
[IF NO] </br> 
	Do you happen to have the phone number of the doctors current office? (IF SO GET UPDATE DR OFFICE NUMBER AND CALL THAT NUMBER). </br>
	</br>
	Thank you for your help.
